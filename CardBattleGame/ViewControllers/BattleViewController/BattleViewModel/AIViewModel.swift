/*
 *Check if AI Play Area already has 5 cards,
 if Yes, attack with one of those. Once all attacks are over, check if AI Play Area still has 5 Cards. If yes, end turn
 
 *if No, check if AI has any playable card based on BP
    if yes, collect its list, check all cards on Player Play Area, compare it and check if any of AI playable cards has more health than the highest atk of player cards. If yes, play that. else, check if one of your card has higher attack power than the highest health in player played cards. If yes, play that. Else play the card with the highest health by default.
 
 *if no, end turn.
 
 *Attack Pattern:
 *Check if player has played cards, collect the list, check if any of your card has more attack than a players cards health and check if the same card has more health than the player card attack. If yes, destroy the player card.
 *Still have attack cards left?
    Find the highest attack power card on player side, check if you have a playable card with more attack power than the health of that card. If yes, use it to destroy it.
 *Still have cards left?
    Hit the player in the FACE!
